The implicit Particle-in-Cell method for the computer simulation of plasma, and its implementation in a three-dimensional parallel code, called iPIC3D, are presented. The implicit integration in time of the Vlasov–Maxwell system, removes the numerical stability constraints and it enables kinetic plasma simulations at magnetohydrodynamics time scales. Simulations of magnetic reconnection in plasma are presented to show the effectiveness of the algorithm.
